# Corpus Synthesis v2.1

Twenty-one frameworks. Four categories. One question: what actually makes AI-assisted development better?

## The Numbers

| Metric | Methodology (n=11) | Orchestrator (n=6) | Domain-Specific (n=2) | Specialty (n=2) | All 21 |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------|
| SOLID Score | 3.98/5.0 | 4.22/5.0 | 3.85/5.0 | 3.90/5.0 | 4.03/5.0 |
| Production Score | 69.5/100 | 75.0/100 | 74.5/100 | 76.5/100 | 72.1/100 |

### What This Corpus Covers

- ✅ Full complexity spectrum (LIGHTWEIGHT → HEAVY)
- ✅ Eleven-way methodology comparison
- ✅ Six orchestration frameworks with diverse approaches
- ✅ Domain-specific coverage for Rails and TypeScript
- ✅ Specialty frameworks for memory and multi-AI coordination

## The Insights Worth Remembering

### 1. Complexity ≠ Quality

RIPER-5 (LIGHTWEIGHT) achieves SOLID 4.2. BMAD Method (HEAVY) achieves 4.3.

Five phases with hard constraints nearly matches 19 agents with 50+ workflows. The lesson isn't "simple is always better"—it's that focused design can achieve excellence without sprawling complexity.

### 2. Category Leaders

| Category | Best Architecture | Most Production-Ready |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Methodology | BMAD (SOLID 4.4) | AB Method (Production 74) |
| Orchestrator | Claude Code by Agents (SOLID 4.5) | wshobson-agents/Claude Task Master (Production 83) |
| Domain-Specific | ClaudeKit (SOLID 4.0) | ClaudeKit (Production 81) |
| Specialty | Crystal (SOLID 4.0) | MoAI-ADK (Production 79) |

Across 21 frameworks, orchestrators achieve the highest average SOLID scores (4.22) while specialty frameworks lead in production readiness (76.5). The best architecture doesn't always mean the most production-ready.

### 3. Active Development Matters

Simone's development paused in August 2024. Its production score: 63. The correlation isn't subtle.

If you're choosing a framework for work that matters, check the commit history.

### 4. Stars ≠ Quality

RIPER-5 (1.9k stars) achieves higher SOLID than frameworks with larger communities. ClaudeKit (399 stars) has the highest production score among domain-specific frameworks.

Community size tells you about reach, not quality.

## Building the Ideal Framework

What if you could combine the best innovations from all 21 frameworks into a single coherent architecture?

**Key Patterns That Transform AI-Assisted Development:**
- **Document Sharding** (BMAD) — 90% token reduction enables enterprise scale
- **Git Worktree Isolation** (Claude Squad) — Mathematical conflict prevention
- **Behavioral Constraints** (RIPER-5) — State machine prevents AI mistakes
- **Fresh Start** (Simone) — Clean context eliminates session pollution
- **Security Patterns** (ClaudeKit) — 195+ vulnerability protections
- **Severity Rules** (SuperClaude) — Priority-weighted instructions
- **Queen-Worker Hive** (Claude Flow) — Coordination when needed
- **Swarm Memory** (Claude Swarm) — 15x token efficiency
- **Convention-Aware Agents** (Claude on Rails) — Deep domain expertise

These patterns aren't just complementary—they actively reinforce each other when integrated correctly.

## Picking a Framework

### By Overhead Tolerance

| What You'll Accept | Framework | Why |
|--------------------|-----------|-----|
| Zero tooling | RIPER-5 | Copy-paste to use |
| Light setup | Simone | GitHub integration |
| Medium setup | SuperClaude | 30-50% token savings |
| Full commitment | BMAD | 19 agents, max governance |

### By Use Case

| Scenario | First Choice | Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Enterprise project | BMAD | Claude Squad |
| Solo development | RIPER-5 | SuperClaude |
| Rails development | Claude on Rails | Claude Squad |
| TypeScript project | ClaudeKit | SuperClaude |
| Parallel execution | Claude Squad | Claude Flow (alpha) |
| Context management | Simone | BMAD |

## What's Next in This Space

Five trends we're watching:

1. **Token Optimization** — Document sharding, compressed formats
2. **Behavioral Constraints** — Phase discipline, severity rules
3. **Isolation Patterns** — Worktrees, no-communication architectures
4. **Context Management** — Fresh starts, template injection
5. **Security Integration** — Pattern libraries, checkpoint systems

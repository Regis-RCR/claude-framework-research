# BMAD Method

**Build More, Architect Dreams** — The enterprise heavyweight of AI-assisted development.

## Quick Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Category** | Methodology |
| **Version** | v6.0.0-alpha.12 |
| **SOLID Score** | 4.4/5.0 |
| **Production Score** | 71/100 |
| **Complexity** | HEAVY |
| **Stars** | 22,900+ |
| **Repository** | [bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) |

## What Makes It Tick

BMAD isn't just a framework—it's a complete philosophy for AI-assisted development. Four phases, 19 specialized agents, 50+ workflows. The highest scores in our entire corpus didn't happen by accident.

The secret? **Document sharding**. Instead of feeding Claude massive documents (and watching your token budget evaporate), BMAD breaks everything into atomic, AI-digestible pieces. Load only what you need, when you need it. The result: 90% token reduction. Not a typo.

## Architecture

```
BMad Core (Universal Engine)
    ↓
BMad Method (Software Development)
    ↓
BMad Builder (Customization)
```

**19 Agent Personas** doing specialized work:
- Product Manager, Business Analyst, Architect
- Frontend/Backend/Fullstack Developers
- QA Engineer, DevOps, Tech Writer
- Design Analyst, Data Architect, Security Analyst
- And a dozen more...

## The Right Fit

**You'll love this if:**
- Enterprise governance isn't optional for you
- Your codebase crossed 50k LOC a while back
- Token costs are eating into your budget
- You want the same methodology across every project

**Maybe look elsewhere if:**
- "Quick prototype" appears anywhere in your brief
- You prefer unstructured AI conversations
- Your team already has a methodology they're married to
- You're working solo on something small

## SOLID Analysis

| Principle | Score | What We Found |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Single Responsibility | 4.5/5 | Each agent stays in its lane |
| Open-Closed | 4.0/5 | BMad Builder handles extensions |
| Liskov Substitution | 4.5/5 | Swap agents without breaking things |
| Interface Segregation | 4.0/5 | Personas get targeted interfaces |
| Dependency Inversion | 4.5/5 | Workflow system is nicely abstracted |

## Production Readiness

- **Reliability:** 90/100 — Active development, comprehensive testing
- **Observability:** 85/100 — Know what's happening in your workflows
- **Security:** 85/100 — Role-based patterns baked in
- **Performance:** 85/100 — That sharding pays off
- **Maintainability:** 90/100 — Clean layers, clear boundaries

## Plays Well With

- **Similar approach:** [SuperClaude](/claude-framework-research/frameworks/superclaude/) (methodology, different flavor)
- **Good combo:** [Claude Squad](/claude-framework-research/frameworks/claude-squad/) (when you need parallel execution)

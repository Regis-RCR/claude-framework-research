## The Core Idea

What if a marketplace of AI agents could be discovered without consuming any tokens? wshobson-agents achieves this through a "zero-token marketplace" pattern where agent capabilities are described in file system structure, not conversation context.

## Key Innovations

- **Zero-Token Marketplace:** Agent discovery without token consumption
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Load agent details only when needed
- **Clean Interfaces:** Highest SOLID score among orchestrators (4.2)
- **Agent-Agnostic:** Works with multiple AI backends

## Who Should Use This

**Perfect match:**
- Teams wanting clean multi-agent architecture
- Token-conscious deployments
- Projects needing modular agent structure

**Probably not for you:**
- Simple single-agent tasks
- Heavy coordination requirements

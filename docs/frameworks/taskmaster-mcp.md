# Task Master

**AI Task Management** — De facto standard for structured project planning in Claude workflows.

## Quick Stats

## The Core Idea

Task Master bridges the gap between high-level product requirements (PRDs) and executable development tasks. Through AI-driven parsing, it transforms unstructured requirements into dependency-aware task graphs that AI assistants can execute systematically.

## Key Innovations

- **PRD Parsing:** AI-driven requirement decomposition
- **MCP Integration:** Task management lives inside AI context
- **Dependency Graphs:** Intelligent task ordering
- **Massive Adoption:** 23.9k stars, industry standard

## Who Should Use This

**Perfect match:**
- Complex projects requiring structured planning
- Teams using PRDs and formal requirements
- Workflows needing task dependency management

**Probably not for you:**
- Simple, one-off coding tasks
- Projects without formal requirements

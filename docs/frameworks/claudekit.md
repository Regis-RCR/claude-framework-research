# ClaudeKit

**TypeScript/JavaScript Development Toolkit** — Security that doesn't sleep.

## Quick Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Category** | Domain-Specific |
| **Version** | 0.9.4 |
| **SOLID Score** | 4.0/5.0 |
| **Production Score** | 81/100 |
| **Complexity** | MODERATE |
| **Stars** | 399 |
| **Repository** | [carlrannaberg/claudekit](https://github.com/carlrannaberg/claudekit) |

## The Numbers Don't Lie

399 GitHub stars. Production score of 81—highest among domain-specific frameworks. SOLID 4.0.

Community size and quality aren't the same thing.

## Security First (Actually)

Everyone claims "security-first." ClaudeKit has **195+ bash security patterns**. Command injection, path traversal, privilege escalation, dangerous operations—all covered with specific protections.

AI-assisted development with guardrails. Non-destructive checkpoints mean you can experiment without fear. Break something? Roll back.

## Architecture

```
6-Phase Spec Workflow
    ↓
24+ Specialist Agents
    ↓
Non-Destructive Checkpoints
    ↓
195+ Bash Security Patterns
```

**What makes it work:**
- Structured 6-phase specification workflow
- TypeScript/JavaScript deep specialization
- Checkpoint-based safe experimentation
- Security pattern enforcement at every step

## Target Audience

**This is for you if:**
- TypeScript/JavaScript is your world
- Security isn't afterthought territory
- You want AI experimentation with rollback
- Enterprise TypeScript applications

**Pass if:**
- You're not in TS/JS land
- Simple scripts (the overhead isn't justified)
- You're comfortable with risk
- Security patterns feel like overhead

## SOLID Analysis

| Principle | Score | What Works |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Single Responsibility | 4.0/5 | Specialist agents stay focused |
| Open-Closed | 4.0/5 | Pattern extension supported |
| Liskov Substitution | 4.0/5 | Agents are interchangeable |
| Interface Segregation | 4.0/5 | Clean TypeScript interfaces |
| Dependency Inversion | 4.0/5 | Type-based abstraction |

Clean 4.0 across all five principles. The consistency suggests thoughtful design, not luck.

## Production Readiness

- **Reliability:** 85/100 — Mature patterns
- **Observability:** 80/100 — TypeScript tooling integration
- **Security:** 90/100 — Those 195+ patterns in action
- **Performance:** 80/100 — Optimized workflows
- **Maintainability:** 80/100 — Clean TypeScript codebase

## What It Protects Against

Real threats, not hypotheticals:
- Command injection
- Path traversal
- Dangerous file operations
- Unvalidated inputs
- Privilege escalation

## Ecosystem

- **Rails equivalent:** [Claude on Rails](/claude-framework-research/frameworks/claude-on-rails/) (domain-specific, Ruby)
- **Behavioral layer:** [SuperClaude](/claude-framework-research/frameworks/superclaude/) (add behavioral modification)

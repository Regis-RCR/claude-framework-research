## The Core Idea

AB Method breaks development into mission-based units with a backend-first philosophy. Each mission is a self-contained unit of work that can be executed independently.

## Key Innovations

- **Mission-Based Decomposition:** Clear unit boundaries
- **Backend-First Philosophy:** API before UI
- **Structured Workflow:** Systematic execution patterns
- **Documentation-Driven:** Specs before code

## Who Should Use This

**Perfect match:**
- API-first development
- Team coordination
- Complex feature development

**Probably not for you:**
- Frontend-only projects
- Quick prototypes

# Claude Code Heavy

**Parallel Research Methodology** — Git worktree isolation for multi-agent research workflows.

## Quick Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Category** | Methodology |

## The Core Idea

Claude Code Heavy transforms a single-threaded AI assistant into a parallel research team. Using Git worktrees, 2-8 Claude Code instances run simultaneously with full context isolation, eliminating cross-contamination between research threads.

## Key Innovations

- **Git Worktree Isolation:** Each agent in its own worktree
- **Parallel Execution:** 2-8 concurrent Claude instances
- **Shell-Based Orchestration:** No external dependencies
- **Research-Focused:** Optimized for document analysis and exploration

## Who Should Use This

**Perfect match:**
- Large-scale research tasks
- Complex codebase exploration
- Tasks decomposable into parallel subtasks

**Probably not for you:**
- Simple sequential workflows
- Projects without Git

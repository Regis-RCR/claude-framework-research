## The Core Idea

CCPM enforces "No Vibe Coding" discipline through a 5-phase workflow where every line of code traces back to documented specifications. GitHub Issues serve as the distributed coordination database.

## Key Innovations

- **Parallel Git Worktree Execution:** 5-8 simultaneous tasks
- **"No Vibe Coding" Discipline:** Spec-traced development
- **GitHub as Database:** Issues for coordination
- **Zero Dependencies:** Pure shell scripts and markdown

## Who Should Use This

**Perfect match:**
- Teams requiring audit trails
- Parallel development workflows
- Specification-driven projects

**Probably not for you:**
- Quick prototypes
- Simple bug fixes
- Solo rapid iteration

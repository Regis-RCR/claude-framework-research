## The Core Idea

Claude Task Master achieves 76% token reduction through a tiered tool loading architecture. Instead of loading all capabilities at once, tools are loaded dynamically based on task requirements.

## Key Innovations

- **Tiered Tool Loading:** 76% token reduction
- **MCP-Native:** Built for Model Context Protocol
- **Intelligent Routing:** Tasks routed to appropriate tools
- **Scalable Architecture:** Handles complex workflows efficiently

## Who Should Use This

**Perfect match:**
- Token-constrained environments
- MCP-based workflows
- Complex multi-step tasks

**Probably not for you:**
- Simple single-tool tasks
- Non-MCP environments

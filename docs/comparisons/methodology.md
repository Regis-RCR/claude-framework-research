# Methodology Framework Comparison

Eleven frameworks. LIGHTWEIGHT to HEAVY complexity. Which one wins?

## The Contenders

| Framework | SOLID | Production | Complexity | Key Innovation |
|-----------|-------|------------|------------|----------------|
| BMAD Method | 4.4/5.0 | 71/100 | HEAVY | Document sharding |
| Task Master MCP | 4.2/5.0 | 74/100 | MODERATE | PRD decomposition |
| RIPER-5 | 4.2/5.0 | 72/100 | LIGHTWEIGHT | Phase constraints |
| Claude Code Dev Kit | 4.2/5.0 | 64/100 | MODERATE | Project scaffolding |
| SuperClaude | 4.1/5.0 | 73/100 | MODERATE | Cognitive personas |
| AB Method | 3.9/5.0 | 74/100 | STANDARD | Mission decomposition |
| NioPD | 3.9/5.0 | 73/100 | STANDARD | Socratic mentorship |
| ContextKit | 3.8/5.0 | 75/100 | STANDARD | Context management |
| Claude Code Heavy | 3.8/5.0 | 52/100 | MODERATE | Worktree research |
| CCPM | 3.7/5.0 | 72/100 | STANDARD | Parallel worktrees |
| Simone | 3.6/5.0 | 63/100 | STANDARD | Fresh-start context |

**Category Average:** SOLID 3.98/5.0 | Production 69.5/100

## The Innovations

Each framework brings something unique to the table.

| Framework | Key Idea | What You Can Steal |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **BMAD Method** | Document sharding (90% token reduction) | Break docs into atomic chunks |
| **Task Master MCP** | PRD-to-task decomposition | Structured project planning |
| **RIPER-5** | Mandatory phase transitions | State machines enforce discipline |
| **SuperClaude** | Priority-weighted rules (CRITICAL→RECOMMENDED) | Weight your instructions |
| **AB Method** | Mission-based decomposition | Backend-first API development |
| **NioPD** | Socratic mentorship | AI-guided problem solving |
| **ContextKit** | Context management | Efficient token utilization |
| **CCPM** | Parallel worktrees | Concurrent development paths |
| **Simone** | Fresh-start + context injection | Clean slate per task |

## The Complexity Spectrum

```
LIGHTWEIGHT       STANDARD                    MODERATE                    HEAVY
   │                │                            │                          │
RIPER-5     AB Method, NioPD,            SuperClaude, Task Master,      BMAD Method
            ContextKit, CCPM,            Claude Code Dev Kit,
            Simone                       Claude Code Heavy
```

## The Surprising Finding

RIPER-5 achieves second-highest SOLID (4.2) with LIGHTWEIGHT complexity—matching Task Master MCP and Claude Code Dev Kit.

| Complexity | Top Framework | SOLID | What This Tells Us |
|------------|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| LIGHTWEIGHT | RIPER-5 | 4.2/5.0 | Focused design excels |
| STANDARD | AB Method | 3.9/5.0 | Simple approaches work |
| MODERATE | Task Master MCP | 4.2/5.0 | Balanced approach succeeds |
| HEAVY | BMAD | 4.4/5.0 | Comprehensive wins (barely) |

You don't need 19 agents to achieve excellent architecture. You need clear constraints precisely applied.

## When to Choose Each

### BMAD Method
- Enterprise governance isn't negotiable
- Full agile lifecycle needs
- Large teams needing role clarity
- Comprehensive artifact generation
- Maximum process discipline

### SuperClaude
- Solo or small team
- Token costs are a real concern
- Behavioral modification approach
- Configurable AI behavior
- Quick setup required

### RIPER-5
- Individual developers
- Immediate adoption scenarios
- Zero tooling overhead
- Behavioral discipline without complexity
- Preventing common AI failure modes

### Simone
- GitHub-native teams
- Long-term context decay mitigation
- Hierarchical task management
- Persistent architectural decisions
- MCP-compatible environments

## Production Leaders

| Framework | Production Score | Why It Works |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| ContextKit | 75/100 | Mature context management |
| AB Method | 74/100 | Focused mission architecture |
| Task Master MCP | 74/100 | Reliable PRD decomposition |
| SuperClaude | 73/100 | Stable configuration layer |
| NioPD | 73/100 | Consistent mentorship model |

Active development correlates with production readiness. Check commit history before committing.

## Mixing and Matching

These aren't mutually exclusive.

**RIPER-5 + Any Orchestrator:**
Embed RIPER-5 behavioral constraints in worker agents. Discipline at every level.

**Simone + BMAD:**
Simone handles context management, BMAD provides process structure.

**SuperClaude + RIPER-5:**
SuperClaude for configuration, RIPER-5 for phase discipline. Belt and suspenders.

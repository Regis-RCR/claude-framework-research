# Domain-Specific Framework Comparison

Rails vs TypeScript. Two specialists. Different outcomes.

## The Numbers

| Dimension | Claude on Rails | ClaudeKit |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **SOLID Score** | 3.7/5.0 | 4.0/5.0 |
| **Production Score** | 68/100 | 81/100 |
| **Community** | 637 stars | 399 stars |
| **Complexity** | MODERATE | MODERATE |
| **Agents** | 7 specialized | 24 specialists |
| **Domain** | Ruby on Rails | TypeScript/JavaScript |

**Category Average:** SOLID 3.85/5.0 | Production 74.5/100

ClaudeKit has fewer stars but higher scores on both metrics. Community size ≠ quality.

## The Architectures

### Claude on Rails: Swarm Intelligence

```
CodeWeaver (Coordinator)
    │
    ├── Architect
    ├── Frontend Developer
    ├── Backend Developer
    ├── Test Engineer
    ├── DevOps
    └── Technical Writer
```

Seven agents that speak Rails. Built by Obie Fernandez—author of "The Rails Way." Deep domain knowledge, not generic code assistance with Rails vocabulary.

### ClaudeKit: Security-First Workflow

```
6-Phase Spec Workflow
    │
    ├── 24+ Specialist Agents
    │
    └── 195+ Bash Security Patterns
        │
        └── Non-Destructive Checkpoints
```

Security isn't an afterthought—it's 195+ specific patterns protecting against real vulnerabilities. Checkpoints mean you can experiment without fear.

## What Each Innovates

| Framework | Key Idea | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Claude on Rails** | Rails-native swarm | Deep Rails convention knowledge |
| **Claude on Rails** | Multi-model coordination | Right model per task |
| **Claude on Rails** | Book integration | Proven patterns |
| **ClaudeKit** | 195+ security patterns | Real vulnerability protection |
| **ClaudeKit** | Non-destructive checkpoints | Safe experimentation |
| **ClaudeKit** | 6-phase spec workflow | Structured development |

## Choosing Between Them

### Claude on Rails Is For:
- Ruby on Rails projects (exclusively)
- Teams wanting Rails-specific AI assistance
- Greenfield Rails applications
- Rails convention enforcement
- Multi-model AI coordination

### ClaudeKit Is For:
- TypeScript/JavaScript projects
- Security-critical development
- Safe AI experimentation with rollback
- Checkpoint-based workflows
- Enterprise TypeScript applications

## Production Breakdown

| Metric | Claude on Rails | ClaudeKit |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Reliability** | 65/100 | 85/100 |
| **Observability** | 70/100 | 80/100 |
| **Security** | 65/100 | 90/100 |
| **Performance** | 75/100 | 80/100 |
| **Maintainability** | 70/100 | 80/100 |

ClaudeKit's 90/100 security score reflects those 195+ patterns doing real work.

## Stack Coverage

| Aspect | Claude on Rails | ClaudeKit |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Language** | Ruby | TypeScript/JavaScript |
| **Framework** | Rails | Any TS/JS framework |
| **Stack** | Full-stack Rails | Frontend/Backend TS |
| **Testing** | RSpec, Minitest | Jest, Vitest |
| **DB** | ActiveRecord | TypeORM, Prisma |

## The Authors

### Claude on Rails
**Obie Fernandez** — Author of "The Rails Way," a canonical Rails reference. Patterns come from his book "Patterns of Application Development Using AI."

Not someone who learned Rails to build an AI wrapper.

### ClaudeKit
**Carl Rannaberg** — Security-first focus. Enterprise security practices baked in from the start.

## What Domain Specialization Proves

Both frameworks show that deep expertise in one technology can achieve competitive scores despite smaller communities:

| Framework | Stars | SOLID | Insight |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------|
| Claude on Rails | 637 | 3.7/5.0 | Rails expertise matters more than community size |
| ClaudeKit | 399 | 4.0/5.0 | Security focus achieves high SOLID |

## Mixing With Others

**Claude on Rails + Claude Squad:**
Parallelize multiple Rails features. Each worktree runs Claude on Rails agents.

**ClaudeKit + SuperClaude:**
ClaudeKit security patterns with SuperClaude behavioral modification.

**Both + RIPER-5:**
Add RIPER-5 phase discipline to either framework for additional structure.
